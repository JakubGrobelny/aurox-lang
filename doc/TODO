1. better error messages (add context to expected_token)
2. fix repl
8. importing files with operators defined may not work correctly
   when multiple files import the same file which has the definitions
9. way of passing operator definitions from file to file 
10. type prettyfying â€“ add brackets around compound type parameters
    (eg. Maybe Maybe Int)
11. remove the dictionary key-value preprocessing
12. consider keeping the type info for expressions to print it after
    execution
13. extract variables from expressions so that closures only
    contain necessary values
