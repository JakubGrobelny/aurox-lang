1. better error messages (add context to expected_token)
2. fix repl
3. change unary/binary operator names so that they are separate functions
4. absolute filenames using unix(argv(Argv))
5. enum(C) vs adt(C, []).
6. change param(a) into prolog variables in type signatures
7. consider removing 'undefined' from patterns and type definitions
8. importing files with operators defined may not work correctly
   when multiple files import the same file which has the definitions
9. typechecker

how to do type infering:
go through environment
if type is defined: check if it is correct (infer value's type and compare)
if type is not defined: infer it
keep a list of visited variables. If type for a variable is undefined then 
infer it.
If type does not match the signature: type error
If type couldn't have been inferred: fail
If there is a type mismatch: type error
